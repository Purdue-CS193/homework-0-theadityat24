# Aditya Tiwari's First CS193 Homework
- Plenty of time to perfect my cookie clicker speedrun
- It's the only class I have in Lawson, despite being a CS major and Lawson being the CS building
- Spending 50min in the basement without access to natural light makes the class really accessible to vampires
